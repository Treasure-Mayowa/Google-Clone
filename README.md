# Google-Clone

Welcome to my Google Clone Project! This project simply clones the aesthetics and function of Google's suite of Web Searches (main, image, advanced). It provides users with a familiar search experience, allowing them to enter search queries and view search results in a similar manner as they would on Google.

#### Languages and Tools Used:
- `HTML5`
- `CSS5`
- `SASS`
- `Bootstrap`


#### `index.html`: This contains the html code for the clone of the main Google Search
#### `image.html`: This contains the html for the clone of Google Image Search
#### `advanced.html`: This contains the html for the clone of Google Advanced Search (simplified)
